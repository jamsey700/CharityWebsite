	<h2>What we do is tackle malnutrition by giving food to malnourished impoverished children around the world</h2>
	<h3>Too many children don’t have the right food to grow up healthy and strong</h3>
	<p>Right now around the world, five children die every minute as a result of malnutrition. Millions more live with the effects for the rest of their lives, because their bodies and brains haven’t developed the way they should. We need to act now to help these children.</p>
	<p>We are working around the clock to treat children suffering from malnutrition, but we’re also tackling the root causes of malnutrition, to prevent more children from becoming malnourished. As well as delivering life-saving food for vulnerable children, we’re also supporting long-term, sustainable nutrition programmes for mothers and babies and working with the Governments of these countries on an ambitious, nationwide programme to prevent malnutrition for all children under five.</p>
	<p>A child’s future depends on what you do today. Your donation can help us build a world where every child is able to reach their full potential. By investing in nutrition, you could help the future of an entire country.</p>
